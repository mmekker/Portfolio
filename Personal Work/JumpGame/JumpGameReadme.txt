This is a very small game I made one night when I just randomly
felt like making a game but wasn't sure what exactly to make. In
this game you play as a blue block and you have to jump off platforms 
in order to not hit the bottom of the screen. The platforms slowly
move down the screen but speed up as the game progresses.
