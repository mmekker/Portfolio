This is my RL2D(Rocket League 2D) game. I created it in my free time to further my knowledge of
Android game development as well as make a fun game. The "RocketLeague2DDoc.odt" is a design document
that I created at the beginning to help organize my ideas and plan out the project. I followed the document
for most of the game but changed a couple things during development. These things were Restricting
cars to their own sides, sound effects, and the control scheme. I would've liked to add in the sound effects
but ran out of time as school started back up and I ran out of time for my break.
